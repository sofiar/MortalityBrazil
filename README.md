## *MortalityBrazil*

### Description 
`MortalityBrazil` provides functions and tools to create and visualize continuous
map of risk by combining spatially discrete mortality data with spatial covariates.

To achieve this aim, a dissagregation model based on the ELGM approach by Stringer and others 2021 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2022.2099403) is implemented. 
This package utilizes source code of the * disaggregation* package:  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/disaggregation/index.html
